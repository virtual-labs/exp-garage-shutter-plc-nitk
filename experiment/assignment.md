<li>If the weight of the garage shutter is 300kg , and the diameter of the shaft used to pull is 5cm. Calculate the torque required to pull the garage shutter?</li>
<li>If the diameter of the shaft used to pull the garage shutter is 5cm and the size of the garage shutter is 8 feet*10 feet, rotation of the shaft is 500rpm. Then calculate the time required by the garage shutter to open completely from its completely closed condition.</li>
<li>If the size of the gate is 8 feet*10 feet and it has to be opened in exact 6 sec, and diameter of the shaft used is 2.4cm. Calculate the speed of rotation of the shaft.</li>
<li>If the mass of the garage shutter is 500kg, and shaft used to pull it, has 3cm diameter. Then calculate the torque required to pull the gate.</li>
